# FIND

The find command is a very versatile utility which allows to search for files and directories based on specific criteria. It recursively traverses a directory hierarchy starting from a given path and matches files and directories that meet the specified conditions.

**Syntax**
```CSS
â–¶ find [path] [expression]
```
  - `[path]` specifies the starting directory for the search. If not provided, it defaults to the current directory.
  - `[expression]` defines the search criteria and actions to perform on matching files/directories.
